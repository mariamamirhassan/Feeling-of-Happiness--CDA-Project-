# Feeling-of-Happiness--CDA-Project-
## Introduction:
The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental aspect of human existence, and understanding the factors that contribute to happiness is crucial for societal well-being. In this study, we aim to explore the determinants of happiness among individuals in Pakistan using categorical data analysis techniques. By examining various socio-demographic factors and their relationship with happiness, we seek to provide valuable insights into the unique cultural and social context of Pakistan.

## Objectives:

To identify significant socio-demographic variables influencing happiness levels in Pakistan.
To develop predictive models using binary logistic regression and multinomial regression to understand the complex interplay of factors affecting happiness.
To assess the goodness of fit and discriminative ability of the developed models.
To provide actionable recommendations based on the findings to promote happiness and well-being in Pakistani society.

## Methodology:

## Data Analysis:

Binary Logistic Regression: We will initially conduct binary logistic regression to explore the binary outcome of 'Happy' and 'Unhappy'. This analysis will help identify significant variables contributing to happiness and assess their impact.
Multinomial Regression: Subsequently, we will employ multinomial regression to understand the factors influencing different levels of happiness. This approach will provide insights into the nuanced relationship between socio-demographic variables and happiness categories.
Model Evaluation: We will assess the goodness of fit of the developed models using appropriate statistical tests such as the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for logistic regression models and chi-squared test for multinomial regression models. Additionally, we will evaluate the discriminative ability of the models using ROC curve analysis.

## Expected Outcomes:

Identification of significant socio-demographic factors influencing happiness levels in Pakistan.
Development of predictive models to understand the complex relationship between socio-demographic variables and happiness.
Insights into potential interventions and policies to promote happiness and well-being in Pakistani society.
